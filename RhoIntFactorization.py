""" Pollard Rho is an integer factorization algorithm,
 	which is quite fast for large numbers. It is based on Floyd’s
  	cycle-finding algorithm and on the observation that two numbers 
  	x and y are congruent modulo p with probability 0.5 after 1.177\sqrt{p}
  	 numbers have been randomly chosen.
